A decentralize web application platform for publishing, networking, and socializing that incentivizes users to have beneficial interactions around the globe.

## Abstract
This app utilizes an ERC20 Token called **OMEN** to incentivize users to create an engaging contents that are real, educational, informative, or helpful. Every single day people around the world interact with each other. People go online to read news, learn from educational resources, watch their favourite video creator, and many more. But all these things are not reachable for everyone since some of these are either paid (subscription-based) or blocked in some places. Creating a platform for all these activities and a system that rewards for these interactions through tokenization will provide the needed boost for a borderless ecosystem of resources around the world.



## App Functionalities

### Self Funding
This application funds itself every single day depending on how users interact, how users use their tokens, and how big the population of users are within the app.

### Post Content
Users will be able to post as long as they are logged-in with the ethereum wallets of their choice. For users without wallets, they can still view any posts but can not post. 

### Tip Omen Tokens & Tip Ether
Within this app, users will be able to tip OMEN coins to the post they want. This will give the content creator a feedback as to how helpful or beneficial their contents are.

### Boost 
Using the OMEN token, users can boost their post to the top of the postings for a few hours. This functionality helps reduce the coin inflation within the app as well.
